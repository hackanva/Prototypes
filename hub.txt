This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the essential steps for conducting thorough regression testing within the SQA environment of the Enrollment System (ES). The ES is a critical platform that enables users to manage and update key aspects of veteran test records, including contact information, health benefit details, demographic data, identity attributes, and other personal information. Additionally, ES provides tools for creating Integrated Control Numbers (ICNs) and correlating test data across the VA Profile network, ensuring seamless integration and accuracy within the system.

This document is designed to guide users through the regression testing process, helping to ensure that all functionalitiesâ€”from data updates to test record managementâ€”perform reliably and maintain the integrity of information across the platform. By following this SOP, testers can validate that ES operates as expected, supporting secure, accurate, and efficient management of veteran enrollment data within the VAâ€™s digital ecosystem.
