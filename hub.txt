PURPOSE:

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to outline the process and objectives of regression testing within the VA.gov ecosystem, focusing on data integrity and synchronization across multiple Veteran Affairs systems, including the Veterans Benefit Management System (VBMS), the Veterans Enrollment System (VES), and the Cerner electronic health record platform. This testing procedure ensures that personal information updates made within VA.gov, such as changes to veterans’ email addresses, mailing addresses, names, surnames, and gender, are accurately reflected and consistently synchronized across interconnected platforms.

Through VA.gov, the testing team accesses veterans’ accounts using unique identifiers, such as ICN numbers or other personal details, to make necessary modifications to sensitive information. Upon saving these changes within VA.gov, this procedure verifies the successful propagation of updated information to the VBMS and VES systems. Additionally, it confirms the accuracy of these changes within the Cerner platform, ensuring seamless data consistency across all systems that support veteran benefits and healthcare management. This SOP is designed to provide thorough, standardized testing protocols to validate data integrity and reliability within VA’s critical enrollment and benefit management systems, thereby supporting enhanced service quality and continuity for veterans.
