The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive guide on utilizing Selenium IDE for executing regression tests during each VA Profile release. By leveraging Selenium IDE’s plug-in functionality, we can efficiently automate the testing process, ensuring that the application maintains its intended functionality and performance standards across releases. This document outlines the steps required to open existing site files, execute the predefined 21 test cases, and record the outcomes accurately. Through this process, we aim to validate that any updates or modifications introduced in the release do not disrupt existing features, thereby upholding a stable and consistent user experience. This guide is intended to support both new and experienced team members, offering a clear, structured approach to navigating Selenium IDE’s interface, managing test scripts, and utilizing essential tools such as recording, pausing, and adjusting execution speed. Ultimately, this document serves to standardize the regression testing process, helping the team to achieve reliable and repeatable results that align with the project’s quality assurance objectives.
