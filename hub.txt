veterans can ensure that their records are current and accurate across VA’s interconnected systems, which include the Veterans Enrollment System (VES), Veterans Benefit Management System (VBMS), and the Cerner healthcare platform.

VA.gov plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and accessibility of veterans’ information by providing them with the tools to independently manage their profiles. By keeping their personal information up to date within VA.gov, veterans help facilitate accurate communication and seamless delivery of benefits and healthcare services across all VA platforms. The site is an essential link between veterans and the benefits they’ve earned, enabling them to manage their information with confidence, security, and convenience.
