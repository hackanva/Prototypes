This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the essential steps for effectively navigating and utilizing the Swagger User Interface (Swagger UI) to validate backend responses and ensure data accuracy across various systems. Swagger UI serves as a critical tool in confirming that updates made on the frontend, through applications such as the Enrollment System (ES), Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), and VA.gov, are accurately transmitted and reflected within the backend environment, specifically within VAProfile.

This document aims to guide users through each step required to test and verify API interactions, allowing them to observe response codes, verify error messages, and confirm that each request and response aligns with the intended functionality. By following this SOP, team members can perform comprehensive testing on various data modifications—such as profile updates, personal information changes, and awards management—validating that these interactions are handled correctly within the backend. This process is crucial for maintaining data integrity, ensuring that any discrepancies are identified and addressed early, thus upholding a reliable and consistent experience for users.

Ultimately, this SOP is designed to provide a standardized, systematic approach to using Swagger UI, empowering testers to execute API validations with precision, detect issues promptly, and ensure that the application’s backend remains synchronized with frontend interactions across all supported platforms.
