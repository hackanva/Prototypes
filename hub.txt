This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the critical steps for performing regression testing on the Ratings and Awards functionalities within the Veterans Benefit Management System (VBMS). This testing process is essential to simulate and validate the accuracy and reliability of the disability claims process that veterans experience. Through VBMS, veterans can submit claims for various service-related disabilities—ranging from Hypertensive Vascular Disease and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to Intervertebral Disc Syndrome and Pulmonary Emphysema—each represented by unique disability codes.

The regression testing process outlined in this SOP covers three core stages: Core, Ratings, and Awards. In the Core phase, veterans submit claims detailing their specific disabilities. In the Ratings phase, each claim is evaluated and assigned a rating that determines the level of benefits based on the severity and type of disability. Finally, in the Awards phase, the claim is finalized with an official benefits award, completing the process.

The primary goal of this regression testing is to ensure that each step, from claim submission to final award, functions seamlessly and accurately. By thoroughly testing these processes, we confirm that VBMS consistently handles disability data, maintains data integrity, and provides a dependable and fair system for veterans seeking rightful benefits. This SOP, therefore, supports both quality assurance and the integrity of service delivery for those who have served.
