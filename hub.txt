This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the essential steps for conducting regression testing within the Quality Assurance (QA) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environments of the Veterans Benefit Management System (VBMS). The objective of this testing is to verify the functionality, accuracy, and reliability of VBMS in managing and updating veterans’ personal information. Through VBMS, users are able to modify contact information, including mailing addresses, phone numbers, and other essential details, ensuring that veterans’ data remains accurate across interconnected VA platforms.

While this SOP specifically addresses the regression testing process for contact information, it excludes the procedures for Ratings and Awards, which are governed by separate SOPs due to their specialized requirements. By focusing on contact information test cases, this regression testing process aims to confirm that any modifications made within VBMS are correctly implemented and do not disrupt existing functionalities. This ensures that data integrity is maintained throughout the system, thereby supporting seamless service delivery and dependable record management for veterans.
