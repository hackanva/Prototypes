Selenium is an open-source suite of automation tools widely used for web application testing. It provides a reliable platform for automating browser actions, allowing teams to test complex user flows and interactions efficiently. Selenium supports various programming languages and browsers, making it an adaptable choice for testing across different environments. The core suite includes WebDriver, Selenium Grid, and Selenium IDE, each designed to address specific aspects of automation and testing.

Selenium IDE, a part of the Selenium suite, is a browser extension that enables users to record and playback browser interactions, making it particularly useful for those who may not be familiar with scripting. Selenium IDE provides a simplified interface to create, edit, and execute automated test cases quickly. In our workflow, we leverage Selenium IDE to open and work with pre-existing project files, streamlining the process of executing and refining test scripts. By importing the predefined site files into Selenium IDE, we can validate the functionality of each element within our application, modify scripts as needed, and ensure that they align with current testing requirements. This approach allows us to identify, document, and address any issues in a controlled environment, supporting both rapid feedback and improved testing accuracy.
