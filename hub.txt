The purpose of this testing process is to conduct regression testing on the Master Person Index (MPI) Toolkit to ensure accurate and consistent synchronization of veteran identity data across interconnected VA systems. By verifying updates made within platforms such as the Veterans Enrollment System (VES) and the Veterans Benefit Management System (VBMS), we assess whether changes to users’ personal information—including updates made to ICNs, VA Profile IDs (VAT 360 IDs), and other key identifiers—are correctly reflected within the MPI Toolkit.
