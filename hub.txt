Background
Before each release, the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) team undertakes a comprehensive testing phase to validate both new functionalities and regression test cases. This process ensures that all components work as expected, providing a seamless experience for end-users and maintaining system stability. For each major release or minor patch update, the UAT team rigorously verifies and records all testing activities within JIRA. Patch releases are tested on an ad-hoc basis, focusing specifically on newly implemented features or resolved bug fixes introduced in the update. This structured approach enables the team to maintain a clear record of testing outcomes, and JIRA serves as a centralized platform for managing and tracking all testing artifacts, results, and any issues that arise.

Purpose
This document serves to offer a detailed, step-by-step guide on efficiently managing UAT testing within the JIRA environment. By following this guide, users will learn how to create and organize test plans, execute test cases, and effectively document results to ensure a comprehensive testing process. The objective is to provide a standardized method for UAT activities, enabling consistency across testing phases and simplifying the tracking and reporting of test progress and outcomes. This documentation is intended to support both new and experienced users in maximizing JIRAâs capabilities for streamlined test management and reliable release quality assurance.
